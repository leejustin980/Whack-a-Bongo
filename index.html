		<h2> Design Process </h2>
		<p> Whack-a-Mole is a simple game that uses a hammer to whack a mole in a hole when it pops up. So I decided to use the same idea by basing my design on the recent meme Bongo Cat. The cursor is a cat and must hit the bongos which make bongo noises. In addition if the cat hits an empty hole, it will meow. Overall, my design was very simple and uses a 30 second countdown for each run of the game. The final score displays the points earned minus the number of misses and the play again button allows you to try again! </p>
